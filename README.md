# edi-partner-onboarding
_A framework for a more efficient, automated, and integrated EDI onboarding process._

## EDI Onboarding Framework  

 **Description**:  _An EDI trading partner onboarding framework for a more integrated and automated EDI process taking an approach that can be applied agnostically and scaled to any organization and their partners.  This framework aims to create an EDI onboarding process that be used in an agnostic manner that is easily scalable to any organization, allowing for a more robust and comprehensive experience for the stakeholders, developers, and other project team members, while providing a consistent, manageable, and repeatable methodology that yields a less error-prone and more efficient Go-Live deployment of a trading partner configuration into a production environment in system and partner integration._


### Framework Objectives  
  
**Objective 1:** High Quality Data and Process Management for A Consistent and Repeatable Onboarding Experience
  
The management of data in the EDI onboarding process is essential to an effective and efficient partner deployment to the intended production environment. The framework provides sample assets that can be used to better collect, review, cleanse, incorporate, and manage data that is essential to the onboarding process in terms of how it is collected and managed internally, as well as how the customer (trading partner) provides the data to the onboarding team.  Additionally, the framework provides sample workflows using common cloud-based technology or SaaS to implement processes and automations that aim to simplify the process to eliminate the change or variances and avoid the introduction of human-based error where possible.  
  
These assets include different web-based forms, surveys, and questionnaires that, when used to gather information from both internal stakeholders and teams, as well as from external stakeholders or partners.  In conjunction with the assets, a few samples of working processes, including automations and integrations with a sample production environment, are included along with corresponding documentations and commentary for clarification.


**Objective 2:**  Provide a EDI Partner Onboarding Roadmap and Project Plan Template  
  
EDI partner onboarding often lacks a concise, documented project plan with stakeholders clearly defined with assigned responsiblities for many reasons, some of which include the complexity of a cross-functional process exisitin within the realms of all organizational departments, the number of stakeholders, and the complexity of requirements that must be met both systematically, proceedurally, and meeting those mandated by the partner.  By providing a project roadmap and project plan template for use, the major aspects of the onboarding process are already aligned as they need be from a "big picture" point of view, and will only require an organization not familiar with EDI to utilize by simmply following a step-by-step guide and assigning responsiblities and actions to stakeholders.  
  
  The project roadmap and plan templates also provides a consistent means of onboarding partners not only internally, but also externally between organizations, which ultimately will promote the ability of organizations that have "not many things in common" to communicate in a way that is predefined and referenceable so that there is a commonality amoung the progression of project steps as well as language for understanding what and when actions and TODO items are being communicated.
